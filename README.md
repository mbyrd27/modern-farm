### Modern Farm

I was hesitant to push this up but, for purposes
of keeping this project backed up, I will continue contributing to it and may go back and remove it at a later date. 

The object is to get all the tests to run successfully following NSS guidelines in Book 1 - Modern Farm. The idea is to practice more with components, functions, and how they interact together.
